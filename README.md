# My quest trying to recreate League of Legends's launcher as a Progressive Web App

Anyone who's ever played **League of Legends** knows the launcher is notoriously slow.

As developers, we know that performance is a tradeoff. If you put time into improving it, you'll take that time away from new features.

I try to be understanding as much as possible, because we all know the struggles of undermanned teams being forced to add new features before they've improved existing ones. It's the business drive added to people not caring about the launcher's performance as much as they say they do -- most people have mid- to high-end computers they game on, anyways. I don't, though, and a significant amount of people get annoyed by the game client's low performance and bugs.

So, while I know that Riot may or may not be to blame for the client's current performance issues -- you could make arguments both ways regarding its priority in their schedule -- I decided I'd try to clone the client and see for myself: **is it possible to make League's client perform better?** While it obviously is, it's unclear whether the possible improvements are large enough that Riot should devote a larger time to this task.

Even if I succeed, the results here are not to be taken as definitive proof that Riot has their priorities wrong -- my launcher clone probably doesn't have as many bindings to external APIs, OS APIs, telemetry, and legacy device support that is most likely invisible to us end users. And if I do not succeed, I hope this teaches me (and possibly others) about the real shortcomings of modern fast-development frameworks sucha as HTML5.
