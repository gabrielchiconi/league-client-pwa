# Dev log 07/08/2020

Yesterday I managed to set up GitHub Actions and Pages so the app is installable by everyone. It even became installable on mobile, but it's really strange there; I don't plan to make "responsive League" a thing just yet, especially because you can't play League from mobile, so you would only be able to manage your profile and read news.

I fixed the color theme a bit, it's still not exactly Riot's but I managed to get the colors from the client this time around using a color picker. I also delved a bit into `mask-image` to make interesting gradient hacks with CSS.

I have also added the player info component to the top right corner. It not currently interactive, but I'm fairly content with the results.

The animations, gradients and sizes in the existing elements have been updated and are more in line with the actual styles in Riot's client. I've also removed the Summoners Rift artwork from the background and added a gradient instead, as that image is only used when Summoners Rift is selected in the lobby.

I've just moved this dev log to separate files as it was getting slightly large.
